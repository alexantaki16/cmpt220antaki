Alex, 

About your programs...

Functionality

- All programs function correctly as required.


Style Check

- You used tabs, which is forbidden. -1pt

- There is incorrect indentation. -1pt

- You are using _System.exit(1)_ wrong. Most of the times I don't think you even
  need that. Consider a simple _return_ statement

Please make sure you follow the style guidelines. Penalties will be higher as
the semester moves forward.


Peace,
